# CopyRice
Silly little bash script to backup several directories and then copy to an external storage device of your choice.
The default directories that are set to be backed up are
~/Documents
~/Pictures
~/Desktop
~/.config
Wanting to create a menue to add additional directories but haven't had time to get to that yet.

## how to run
1. Clone this repo
   git clone https://github.com/howmanygrapes/CopyRice.git

2. cd into directory and chmod +x
   cd /path/to/CopyRice && chmod +x CopyRice.sh

3. Run it
   ./CopyRice.sh

## additional comments
Still very much a beginner when it comes to writting bash scripts, so there very well may be things that could be done a lot better and cleaner.
Feedback is always very much appreciated!
